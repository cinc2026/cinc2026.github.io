### Oral Presentations
* The time allocated for each oral presentation is 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes for Q&A. The only exception to the 10-minute limit for oral presentations is for the four finalists in the Rosanna Degani Young Investigator Award competition, who are each allotted 15 minutes for their talks, followed by 5 minutes for discussion.
* You will be introduced by the sessionâ€™s Chairperson, who will also open the Q&A session after your presentation.
* Questions will be exclusively asked at the end of each speech, aiming to minimize interruptions and ensure a seamless online experience for attendees. Please be aware that during the Q&A session. 
* Speakers are expected to adhere strictly to the event schedule, which will be enforced to finish sessions on time and to permit participants to move successfully from one parallel session to another. 
* Prepare your presentation before coming to the conference using suitable software, e.g, Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, or PDF. If your presentation includes video content, make sure it plays properly on the system available at the conference venue by testing it beforehand. 
* Speakers may bring your presentation to CinC on a USB memory stick and assume that there will be a Windows compatible laptop and laser pointer available to upload. You may also bring your own laptop but be sure to also bring necessary adapters for both HDMI and VGA projector inputs. 

### Oral Presentation Check-in
